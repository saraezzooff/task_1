        <h3>Acoustic Guitars vs Electric Guitars</h3>
        <p><strong>acoustic guitar: </strong> is a musical instrument in the guitar family. Its <em>strings</em> vibrate a sound board 
            on a resonant body to project a sound wave through the air. ...
             The string causes the soundboard and the air enclosed by the sound box to vibrate.</p>
        <p><strong>Electric Guitars:</strong> is a guitar that requires external <em> amplification</em> in order to be heard at typical 
            performance volumes. It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration 
            of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers.</p>
